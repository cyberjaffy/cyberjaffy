# Hi there, I’m Jafaru 👋

## 🛠️ About Me
- 💼 Cloud Administrator / DevOps Engineer with expertise in cloud security, networking, infrastructure automation, and Microsoft Azure administration currently working with Huawei cloud.  
- 🔐 Passionate about designing secure, scalable cloud solutions while maintaining network integrity and operational reliability.  
- 🌩️ Skilled in managing hybrid and multi-cloud environments, integrating technologies, and optimizing IT infrastructures for resilience and performance.  
- 🚀 Currently gaining advanced hands-on experience in Kubernetes cluster management, NGINX ingress troubleshooting, VPN configuration, SSL/TLS lifecycle management, and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🌟 What I Do
- 🛡️ Configure and manage enterprise security solutions to safeguard data and infrastructure from vulnerabilities.  
- 🌐 Design and maintain secure networks (VPNs, firewalls, routing tables, load balancing) for seamless connectivity across cloud and on-premises environments.  
- 🛠️ Administer Kubernetes clusters using kubectl, Lens, and GitOps tools (ArgoCD) for application deployment and monitoring.  
- 🔄 Automate SSL/TLS certificate renewals and maintain secure ingress configurations to ensure uptime and compliance.  
- 🐳 Manage containerized services and resolve deployment issues with Docker, GitHub Actions, and Nexus repositories.  
- ⚙️ Troubleshoot critical production issues — from ingress misconfigurations and fake certificates to network routing errors and authentication failures in Keycloak.  
- 📊 Support operational decision-making through log analysis and monitoring using NGINX access/error logs, Loki, Grafana, and Metabase.

## 📚 Skills
- ☁️ **Cloud Platforms:** Microsoft Azure, AWS, Huawei Cloud  
- 🔐 **Security:** Microsoft Defender, Bitdefender, SSL/TLS, Keycloak (IAM), best practices for certificate management  
- 🌐 **Networking:** TCP/IP, DNS, SMTP, NAT gateways, firewall rules, VPN setup & troubleshooting, routing tables  
- 🐳 **Containers & Orchestration:** Kubernetes (kubectl, Lens, manifests, ingress, kustomize), Docker, Helm
- ⚙️ **CI/CD & Automation:** GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Nexus, GitOps workflows, Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform )  
- 🔍 **Monitoring & Logging:** NGINX access/error logs, Loki, Grafana dashboards, log parsing, Metabase

## 💼 Experience Highlights
- 🏗️ **VPN Configuration:** Designed and deployed Point-to-Site VPN access for development and production users, enabling secure remote connectivity.  
- 🔐 **SSL/TLS Management:** Renewed and automated SSL certificates across production and development environments, preventing downtime from expired certificates.  
- 🌐 **Ingress Troubleshooting:** Resolved a fake Kubernetes ingress certificate issue, ensuring valid TLS termination with Let’s Encrypt.  
- ⚙️ **NGINX Debugging:** Analyzed duplicate/conflicting server blocks in nginx.conf and fixed misconfigurations causing partner connectivity errors.  
- 🔄 **Authentication Debugging:** Investigated and validated Keycloak client credential flows, resolving 401/invalid client errors for partner integrations.  
- 📦 **CI/CD Improvements:** Troubleshot deployment failures by fixing missing dependencies in Nexus repositories and validating ArgoCD sync processes.  
- 🐳 **Container & Cluster Admin:** Managed microservices in Kubernetes with kubectl and Lens, verifying pods, configurations, ingress rules, and deployment health.  
- 📊 **Operational Insights:** Leveraged access logs and API traces to differentiate between working and failing requests, proving authentication was the root issue for partner errors.  
- 🛡️ **Cloud Storage Security:** Configured and tested bucket policies to balance accessibility and compliance requirements.
